# Pet Play

Pet owners often face challenges in finding suitable playmates for their pets, leading to limited socialization and reduced well-being for pets. PetPlay aims to solve this by providing a dedicated platform where pet owners can create profiles for their pets, discover compatible playmates, and arrange playdates, thereby enhancing the social lives of their pets and fostering a connected community of pet enthusiasts.

This project was created with Vite+Tailwind CSS. While this version was submitted for my capstone project, the project itself is currently a work in progress
